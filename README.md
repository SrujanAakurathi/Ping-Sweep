# Ping-Sweep
Short script to perform a ping sweep of your current subnet

<b>What is PING SWEEP? </b>
  
  <b>Ping Sweep</b> is a method that can establish a range of IP addresses which map to live hosts. The classic tool used for ping sweeps is <b>fping</b>, which traditionally was accompanied by gping to generate the list of hosts for large subnets, although a more recent version of fping includes that functionality. Well-known tools with ping sweep capability include nmap for Unix systems and the Pinger software from Rhino9 for Windows NT.
